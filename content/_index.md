# Bixxzy

Welcome home, kutties üèéÔ∏èüí®

Elloww, Bixxzy here. A university student, computer programmer, Secretary of [SOTC PU](https://sotcpu.me/) and {privacy, digital commons, free software} advocate.
 
 I consider this site as a way to express myself, and a platform to share my thoughts. 
 This site is a reflection of who I am, what I do, and what I love.
  It's a space where I can be myself. 
  This will be my minimalistic blog and also this can be considered as my journal sometimes.
